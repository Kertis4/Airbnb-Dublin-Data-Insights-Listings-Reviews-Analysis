Data analysis of Airbnb listings and reviews in Dublin using Python. Highlights trends in pricing, host activity, and neighbourhood patterns with clear visualisations.

Overview
This analysis focuses on Airbnb listings and their associated review data to extract actionable insights. By exploring and merging the dataset, the goal is to evaluate trends in rental pricing, review scores, and the influence of neighborhood characteristics. Key performance metrics such as average review scores, rental price distributions, and host performance are analyzed to help understand market dynamics and provide strategic insights for stakeholders in the real estate or hospitality industry.

Key Insights
1. Average Review Scores by Neighborhood
By aggregating the review data based on neighborhoods, the analysis identifies areas with the highest and lowest average review scores. These insights are critical for understanding how property locations influence guest satisfaction.

Actionable Insight: Neighborhoods with higher review scores may be considered more desirable areas for investment or marketing, while areas with lower scores could benefit from targeted improvements.

2. Cumulative Rental Prices by Host
The analysis of hosts and their cumulative rental price earnings highlights the top performers in terms of revenue. This metric allows for an understanding of which hosts are commanding higher prices, either through offering more premium listings or through higher volumes of bookings.

Actionable Insight: Identifying top hosts can help inform best practices for new or struggling hosts, providing insights into what drives higher rental income in the platform.

3. Price Distribution Across Listing Types
A breakdown of rental prices by room type (e.g., private room, shared room, entire home) reveals the pricing structure and how different property types are positioned within the market.

Actionable Insight: Understanding the distribution of rental prices by room type allows for better market segmentation. Hosts can use this data to optimize their pricing strategy, while investors can identify gaps in the market for different listing types.

4. Geographic Influence on Rental Prices
A geographic comparison of rental prices across different official neighborhoods provides insight into how location impacts rental pricing. By focusing on neighborhoods like Dn Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal, it is possible to draw conclusions about pricing differences across various regions.

Actionable Insight: Location-specific pricing strategies can be developed based on these insights, helping hosts tailor their offerings to the market dynamics of their specific area.
